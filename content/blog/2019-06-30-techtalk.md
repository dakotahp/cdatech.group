### Introduction to Elixir
By Karmen Blake

> Come get an introduction to a language whose syntax and ecosystem are top-notch and actively been in development since 2012. Built on top of the BEAM (Erlang Virtual Machine) it relies on decades of industry-strength stability of Erlang. In a world where multicore systems are increasing, Elixir leverages that natively and makes concurrency approachable. The language allows you to build and design fault-tolerant systems so that you can confidently rely on long running applications. Also, come see other tools and frameworks that rely on Elixir: Phoenix (realtime web applications), Nerves (apps for embedded hardware), and Scenic (UI applications)
