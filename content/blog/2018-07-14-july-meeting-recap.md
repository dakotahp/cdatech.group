We had a great turnout for July. Several new folks showed up from different tech related industries like home automation.

# How to Find The Group

I'm not sure if everybody who RSVPed was in attendance and I apologize if you missed the notification of where to find us. I had sent out a notification to those that were planning to attend around 2pm and then a couple more people RSVPed and didn't get the notification.

In the future I will send those emails to the _whole_ group rather than just those on the RSVP list. Additionally, I will send out a final email once I arrive at the venue clarifying exactly where I am to make it even easier.
