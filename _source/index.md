The Coeur d'Alene Tech Group is a user group for tech industry people in or near
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. We exist for people involved in the tech scene including
designers, software developers, system administrators, product people,
entrepreneurs, and more.

We change up the location each meeting to sample brews from different places in
Kootenai County. Come hang out and learn from each other in the exciting world
of tech startups.

# Participation

There are a few ways to participate in our group. We have monthly meetups at
rotating venues around the Kootenai County. These meet ups are scheduled on the
[Meetup.com page](https://www.meetup.com/Coeur-dAlene-Tech-Group/) but you don't
need to sign up to attend.
